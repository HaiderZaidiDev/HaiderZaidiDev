### Hey, I'm Haider ðŸ‘‹

As a developer and someone who loves creating things; my background deviates from one of a traditional business student, empowering me to attack problems through multiple perspectives, sync well with cross-functional teams and hold a deep understanding in what makes an exemplary product.

## Projects :space_invader:
Here's some _interesting projects_ I have recently worked on:
- **[WebumÃ©](https://webume.ca):** A web-app for students to create their own website-based resumÃ©s to stand out in recruiting.
- **[Twitter Clone](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/twitter-clone):** A twitter-clone featuring tweets, likes, retweets, link recognition and spam filters.
- **[Assignment Tracker](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/canvas-assignments-tracker):** A website which generates spreadsheets for students at my University with their coursework for the semester.
- **[Finacial Data](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/Financial-Data-Scraper):** A financial data scraper with fetches over 25 financial ratios, querying and plotting share prices from a REST API.

And a couple of _smaller projects_ I'm proud of:
- A [web-app](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/Coffee-Returns) that calculates the opportunity cost of buying Starbucks vs. Investing in the S&P 500
- A [script](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/starbucks-menu-scraper) that scrapes Starbucks' revenue, using Monte Carlo to simulate orders and yearly revenue.
- An [app](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/eventbrite-ticket-booking) that books timeslots for my apartment's gym.
