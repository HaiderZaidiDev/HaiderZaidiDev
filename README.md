### Hey, I'm Haider ðŸ‘‹

As a developer and someone who loves creating things; my background deviates from one of a traditional business student, empowering me to attack problems through multiple perspectives, sync well with cross-functional teams and hold a deep understanding in what makes an exemplary product.

## Projects :space_invader:
Here's some _interesting projects_ I have recently worked on:
- **[Virtual (AR) Steering Wheel](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev?tab=repositories):** An augmented reality steering wheel with Python (OpenCV) and machine learning models from Mediaipe
- **[WebumÃ©](https://webume.ca):** A web-app for students to create their own website-based resumÃ©s (Python/Django)
- **[Twitter Clone](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/twitter-clone):** A twitter-clone featuring tweets, likes, retweets, link recognition and spam filters (React/Node.js).
- **[Assignment Tracker](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/canvas-assignments-tracker):** A website which generates spreadsheets for students at my University with their coursework for the semester (Python/Django).
- **[Finacial Data](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/Financial-Data-Scraper):** A financial data scraper which fetches over 25 financial ratios, querying and plotting share prices from a REST API (Python/Django).

And a couple of _smaller projects_ I'm proud of:
