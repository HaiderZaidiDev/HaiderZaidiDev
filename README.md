I'm a student in the BBA program at the Schulich School of Business, with a strong passion for development, design, and finance. My favourite technoigies right now are Python, Django, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. I'm also in the process of learning ReactJS. My trifecta of passions has empowered me to create some cool things, like [Financial Data](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/Financial-Data), a Django app which provides a companies financial data (e.g ratios and share price) given a stock's ticker symbol, or [Pin Archiver](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/Discord-Pin-Archiver-Bot), a bot which archives pinned messages on Discord.
